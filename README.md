## Hola, soy Dani

    🎨 I’m passionate about developing tools that apply computer graphics concepts in practical and creative ways,
    🔭 I graduated with Merit from the MSc in Computer Animation and Visual Effects at Bournemouth University in the UK,
    🌱 I maintain a personal website where I regularly update my projects, write posts, and share resources to help others get started in computer graphics: graphicsjournal.com,
    🚀 I’m currently working as the Graphics Technical Lead at PixelMux, a startup exploring speech‑driven video generation and DCC pipelines: pixelmux.com,
    ✨ My personal phrase is: I want to touch my limits, not imagine them.
