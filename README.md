ðŸŽ¨ I am passionate about developing tools that leverage computer graphics concepts.  
ðŸ”­ Currently, I am pursuing a MSc in Computer Animation and Visual Effects at Bournemouth University in UK.  
ðŸŒ± I maintain a personal website where I regularly update my projects, write posts, and share resources to introduce others to computer graphics. [graphicsjournal.com](https://graphicsjournal.com/)  
ðŸš€ I am the co-founder and Chief Graphics Officer of PixelMux, a tool designed to animate videos using AI. [pixelmux.com](https://pixelmux.com/)  
âœ¨ My personal phrase is: I want to touch my limits, not imagine them.
